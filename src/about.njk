      </div>

      <div class="card accent-border">
        <p>We want to become the ultimate community platform, where we discuss the hottest trends and biggest problems in NZ software engineering, and grow together.</p>
        <p>We want to see NZ software engineering community be inspired by how other local companies and engineers are thriving. We're keen to hear kiwis share how they address different engineering concerns in the NZ context, and feel empowered to try those solutions out at their organisations.</p>
        <p>NZ Tech Rally will do this, by providing opportunities to showcase NZ ingenuity in software engineering through conferences, smaller events, and online content.</p>

          <h3>Community focused</h3>
          <p>We focus on empowering NZ tech community to build, share, uplift, and showcase kiwi software engineering culture.</p>
        </li>
        <li class="card accent-border">
          <h3>Accessible and affordable</h3>
          <p>
            We want anyone to be able to access our content and event. Therefore, our platform should be as easy to use and reasonably priced whenever possible.

        <li class="card accent-border">
          <h3>Inclusive</h3>
          <p>
            We want to see more diverse representation of software engineers in New Zealand. We do this through curation of voices from different abilities, career progression, life stages, and ethnic groups.

            We focus on empowering people and the community. We do not endorse groups who take advantage of, or try to push their products onto the community.
