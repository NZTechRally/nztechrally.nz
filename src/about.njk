      <div class="card accent-border">
        <p>Provide inclusive spaces for the NZ software community to connect and grow together.</p>
        <p>We want to see NZ software engineering community be inspired by how other local companies and engineers are thriving. We're keen to hear Kiwis share how they address different engineering concerns in the NZ context, and feel empowered to try those solutions out at their organisations.</p>
        <p>NZ Tech Rally will do this by:</p> 
        <ul>
          <li>Showcasing NZ ingenuity in software</li>
          <li>Providing opportunities to grow your network and impact</li>
          <li>Creating safe, inclusive, accessible and diverse educational content</li>
          <li>Sharing good software practices and emerging technologies</li>
        </ul>

          <h3>Community focused</h3>
          <p>We focus on empowering NZ tech community to build, share, uplift, and showcase Kiwi software engineering culture.</p>
        </li>
        <li class="card accent-border">
          <h3>Accessible and affordable</h3>
          <p>
            We want anyone to be able to access our content and event. Therefore, our platform should be as easy to use and reasonably priced whenever possible.

        <li class="card accent-border">
          <h3>Inclusive</h3>
          <p>
            We want to see more diverse representation of software engineers in New Zealand. We do this through curation of voices from different abilities, career progression, life stages, and ethnic groups.

          <h3>People over product</h3>
          <p>
            We focus on empowering people and the community. We do not endorse groups who take advantage of, or try to push their products onto the community.
