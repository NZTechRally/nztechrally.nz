Claire Sole is a dedicated Engineering Lead at BNZ with a strong background in front-end development.

With a diverse career journey beginning in sales, customer service and people, she pivoted directions in her mid 20â€™s by earning her diploma and entering into the world of tech. From there she has spent the last 12 years growing these technical skills before recently having the opportunity to combine both people and tech in her new role as Engineering Lead.

Claire enjoys motivating and supporting teams with empathy, understanding, and where needed; a little humour. Ironically passionate about empowering others, while still navigating her own self-doubt and insecurities.

Outside of work, Claire is a proud wife and mother of two, a fiber artist, and always seeking new creative outlets.
