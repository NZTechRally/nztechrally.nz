{% layoutblock 'talkAbout' %}

<p>New Zealand organisations use DevOps practices and culture in different ways.</p>

<p>In this talk, we will investigate how different sizes and scale organisations are using DevOps technical and cultural practices to drive different outcomes.</p>

<p>We will investigate how in large enterprises, DevOps is more about assurance and safety, whereas, in resource-constrained startups, DevOps is about speed and learning.</p>
