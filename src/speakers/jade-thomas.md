<p>
  Financial institutions have a reputation for being slow and cumbersome with software delivery and there is often a good reason for that: we deal with your money.
</p>

<p>
  The consequences of any mishap can be enormous. not just financial and reputational but also remediation imposed by regulators can be crippling.
</p>

<p>
  However, at what point does this lack of agility become a risk in itself and how do you balance speed to market, compliance and certainty?
