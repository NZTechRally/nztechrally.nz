fullName: Jade Thomas
jobTitle: Engineering Manager Online Channels
organisation: BNZ
bio: "<p>After a couple of decades of software development, Jade accidentally found himself in an engineering leadership role. Initially not keen on the engineering manager title, as he never saw himself as a manager, but enticed by the hope of having some influence in building a better environment for engineers to flourish. Jade fights to keep the management part of the role to a minimum while trying to stay relevant and valuable to engineers.</p>

<p>Over the last 4 years as manager, Jade has been involved in reshaping BNZ online banking ways of working — standardising and industrialising their software patterns, increasing their scalability and reliability — all while the organisation reshapes their technology business unit.</p>"

<p>
  Financial institutions have a reputation for being slow and cumbersome with software delivery, and there is often a good reason for that: we deal with your money.
</p>

<p>
  The consequences of any mishap can be enormous; not just financial and reputational, but also remediation imposed by regulators can be crippling.
</p>

<p>
  However, at what point does this lack of agility become a risk, and how do you balance speed to market, compliance and certainty?
