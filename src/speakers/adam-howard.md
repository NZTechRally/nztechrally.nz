<p>Quality is a slippery notion, and not something that can simply be manufactured and measured. In that sense, it’s a lot like culture.</p>

<p>And just as culture is emergent from a peoples’ values and behaviours, quality emerges from teams’ principles and practices.</p>

<p>In this talk, Adam describes a model for shaping those principles and practices in engineering teams that can nurture a culture of quality engineering.</p>

<p>
Prae: So now that the stage have been
magically or not magically reset,
let's dive into another aspect of the engineering
practice that is again very core to culture.</p>

<p>
That is quality. 
</p> 

<p>
I've personally felt the impact
of our next speaker's approach to Quality practice,
even though, we have never worked in the same
team in the five years that I've been in the 
same company with him. 
</p> 

<p>
His style of communication insights and the pragmatic approach to influence is something to be admired. </p>

<p>
Something that you can just feel and see from far, from the way he talks and things.
</p>

<p> 
So I'm delighted to welcome Adam Howard, an engineering manager. [Applause]
</p>

<p>
Adam: All right, Hello everyone. I was worried we might be in the post-lunch lull but you're all rowdy enough to require free claps from Prae there. So that's good news.
</p>

<p> 
So yeah my name is Adam and I've been in the quality space for like 12 years and I still apparently can't resist using quality as an adjective and a noun successively. 
</p>

<p>
It'sa joke I never get tired of, but here we are.
</p>

<p>
I'm here today to talk about the core engineering domain within engineering, and more specifically, how I've attempted to foster a culture of quality Engineering in my work.
</p>

<p>
So my employer is a bit shy about people representing them sometimes. 
</p>

<p>
So I want to assure you this is all very much based in my experience at work and I'll doubtless mention them a few times along the way.
</p>

</p>But please do me the kindness of remembering this is purely my views as an individual and if I happen to say the word "Zero" at any point, it definitely starts with a Z, okay.
</p>

<p>
Before we get into the meat of it, I want to ensure that we all know what we're talking about when we say culture.
</p>

<p>
It's kind 
of a slippery notion. We've heard lots about 
it today already.
</p>

<p>
But you know lunch and panels 
and excitement, we might have blank minds by now.
</p>

<p>
So for me, the way that I think about culture 
is, it's the sort of intangible social goo that 
a group of people sort of float around in and 
crucially, that goo is created by or I suppose more actually emerges, from the experiences 
of the people in a community.
</p>

<p>
And when I think about those social experiences, there's three 
main things that shape culture. 
</p>

<p>
There's the values that people hold, so the things that are important to them, the things that they hold dear, the beliefs that shape the way that they see 
the world. 
</p>

<p>
There's the behaviours, the things that people actually do, how they conduct themselves, the actions that they choose to take.    
</p>

<p>
There's the values that people hold, so the things that are 
important to them, the things that they hold dear, the beliefs that shape the way that they see 
the world. There's the behaviours, the things that
people actually do, how they conduct themselves,
the actions that they choose to take. 
</p>

<p>
And finally, there's the interactions; the way that people's 
values and behaviours intersect, and the way - in essence - that people affect, like have an effect 
on each other and the world around them. 
</p>

<p>
And with that in mind, culture is a constantly shifting 
evolving thing.
</p>

<p>
The culture of New Zealand now, 
is very different to what it was say even three 
four years ago - our shared experiences of a global 
pandemic, cost of living crisis.
</p>

<p>
All of the potentially great and terrible 
things that have happened over the last couple of 
years, they've forever changed the things that we 
value, the ways that we behave and how we interact 
with one another and our environment.    
</p>

<p>
And those 
changes mean that the intangible goo that is our 
shared culture, is now different. What it feels 
like to live in and experience life as a New 
Zealander is different.
</p>

<p>
Because while culture is intangible in the sense that you can't touch it or even easily describe it, as I'm demonstrating we all feel it.
</p>

<p>
To a greater or lesser degree, we all live in culture, and sometimes that's good, and sometimes it's bad. 
</p>

<p>
It's also precisely why shaping culture or changing it is something really powerful. 
</p>

<p>
If we can change the culture that we're a part of, we can change the experiences of ourselves and others - for better, or for worse.
</p>

<p>
Crucially, we must remember though, that we can't change culture directly.
</p>

<p>
It's an abstract, emergent, intangible thing and so you cannot simply mould it in a given direction. 
</p>

<p>
So no matter how much your CEO or your senior leaders want to 
instil a "great culture" in your organization, they can't just tell you and make it happen,
which doesn't stop people trying. 
</p> 

<p>
Surprisingly common to see people have a crack at that, but it won't work just to say this is our culture now, because it emerges from people, and 
people are quite hard to change but let's have a go.
</p>

<p>
So pivoting slightly to my day 
job.
</p>

<p>
Here I am, a big old nerd walking in on day one, a job in which I was hired to help 
improve the practice of quality engineering.
</p>

<p>
They didn't actually say that, though they 
kind of said we have a problem with quality.
</p>

<p>
But to me that's what it meant it meant,
"Please build the quality engineering capability of our teams".
</p>

<p>
And I was pretty nervous 
about that actually, it's a big global company and even before I joined, I knew that 
they moved fast and they did lots of things.
</p>

<p>
I also quickly learned when I started, that 
the teams had heaps of autonomy to choose how they 
worked and what they did, and in some ways this 
was really good, but it also meant there was a 
lot of unhelpful diversity in terms of how 
they did things, and this was especially true
in the quality engineering space, where there 
hadn't really been any technical or strategic 
leadership for a little while. 
</p>

<p>
And so lots 
of teams were doing their best but they were all solving the same problem in different 
ways and with differing degrees of success.
</p>

<p>
So I approached with caution because it really 
felt like I might be trying to put stuff back into 
Pandora's Box and they'd had the freedom to choose 
how they were doing things and then this guy sort 
of comes along out of nowhere and might try and 
tell them, "Oh, maybe you should do it differently".
</p>

<p>
So this anxiety was kind of rooted 
in my unfamiliarity with the culture - 
though I wasn't conscious of that at the 
time. 
</p>

<p>
At this stage, I didn't know that I was going to instigate a cultural change that wasn't 
my grand plan.
</p>

<p>But clearly my instinct as a new entrant into this community was to respect the 
culture, not to go in there and just disregard it and muck it up.
</p>

<p>
I'd seen someone attempt that kind 
of approach in a previous job - they sort of brought the culture of their prior organization and tried 
to apply it like a paste over the top of a new and 
unfamiliar canvas and it didn't work out well for 
the cultural colonizer and I wasn't about to make that same mistake. 
</p>

<p>
But I did intend to succeed in 
building capability - and I decided that the way to do it was not through colonization of ideas or 
conquering of hierarchy - it was through enablement.
</p>

<p>
In reality, I think I recognized that the only 
way I could achieve the scale of change that 
I was aiming for was to help the people and 
the teams themselves to be the real drivers behind that change.
</p>

<p>
If I could enable them, 
then they would change the culture for me.
</p>

<p>
So the first thing I set about doing was building a community.
It was pretty clear to 
me that while Communities of Practice were a big thing 
at Xero, there wasn't a healthy Community around 
Quality Engineering. 
</p>

<p>
Though there were relics, there 
was you know, a dusty old Confluence space, there was a largely dormant slack Channel but nobody 
was talking about quality engineering, at least not 
outside of their direct teams.
</p>

<p>
And so I knew this 
had to be one of the first things that I focus on.  
</p>

<p>
Because I'd also quickly discovered that there 
were a lot of super talented super smart people who cared about quality all around the place.
</p>

<p>
Some of them were Quality Specialists, QA's or quality coaches. But a lot were also developers, 
engineers who were just really passionate about 
delivering high-quality software. 
</p>

<p>
And what's more, 
they typically knew that they needed a bit of help.
