{% layoutblock 'talkAbout' %}

<p>Quality is a slippery notion, and not something that can simply be manufactured and measured. In that sense, it’s a lot like culture.</p>

<p>And just as culture is emergent from a peoples’ values and behaviours, quality emerges from teams’ principles and practices.</p>

<p>In this talk, Adam describes a model for shaping those principles and practices in engineering teams that can nurture a culture of quality engineering.</p>

<p>
Prae: So now that the stage have been 
magically or not magically reset,
let's dive into another aspect of the engineering
practice that is again very core to culture. </p>

<p>
That is quality. 
</p> 

<p>
I've personally felt the impact 
of our next speaker's approach to Quality practice,  
even though, we have never worked in the same 
team in the five years that I've been in the  
same company with him. 
</p> 

<p>
His style of communication 
insights and the pragmatic approach to influence  
is something to be admired. Something that you 
can just feel and see from far, from the way he  
talks and things.
</p>

<p> 
So I'm delighted to welcome 
Adam Howard, an engineering manager. [Applause]
</p>  

<p>
Adam: All right, Hello everyone. I was worried we might 
be in the post-lunch lull but you're all rowdy  
enough to require free claps from Prae there. So 
that's good news.
</p>

<p> 
So yeah my name is Adam and  
I've been in the quality space for like 12 years 
and I still apparently can't resist using quality  
as an adjective and a noun successively. It's 
a joke I never get tired of, but here we are.  
</p>

<p>
I'm here today to talk about the core 
engineering domain within engineering, and  
more specifically, how I've attempted to foster 
a culture of quality Engineering in my work.  
</p>

<p>
So my employer is a bit shy about people 
representing them sometimes. 
</p>

<p>
So I want to  
assure you this is all very much based in my 
experience at work and I'll doubtless mention them  
a few times along the way. But please do me the 
kindness of remembering this is purely my views as  
an individual and if I happen to say the word "Zero" 
at any point, it definitely starts with a Z, okay.
</p>

<p>
Before we get into the meat of 
it, I want to ensure that we all know what we're  
talking about when we say culture.
</p>

<p>
It's kind 
of a slippery notion. We've heard lots about  
it today already. But you know lunch and panels 
and excitement, we might have blank minds by now.
