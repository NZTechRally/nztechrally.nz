Adam is a quality engineering specialist, and is passionate about continually improving how teams are able to rapidly deliver quality software products.

His career has seen him help transform and evolve the way that some of New Zealand’s most successful technology companies think about and approach quality engineering; with a bias towards the collective, the context-driven, and the pragmatic. He’s also regularly shared his experiences through speaking at conferences and meet-ups, providing training and coaching, and contributing  to the quality community in New Zealand and around the world.

Adam currently leads the quality engineering practice at Xero.
