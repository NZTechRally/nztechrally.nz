<p>Quality is a slippery notion, and not something that can simply be manufactured and measured. In that sense, it’s a lot like culture.</p>

<p>And just as culture is emergent from a peoples’ values and behaviours, quality emerges from teams’ principles and practices.</p>

<p>In this talk, Adam describes a model for shaping those principles and practices in engineering teams that can nurture a culture of quality engineering.</p>
