bio: "<p>Katrina moved into engineering leadership from a varied career in individual contributor roles across software development, solution delivery engineering, and testing. She became “famous” in the international testing community as the author of A Practical Guide to Testing in DevOps, an international keynote speaker, a co-founder of the WeTest New Zealand testing community, the founder of Testing Trapeze magazine, and a prolific testing blogger and tweeter back when those platforms were popular.</p>

<p>Over the last five years Katrina has been responsible for leading engineering culture at a variety of NZ organisations. She has worked in a large bank, a high-growth SaaS business, and a Series B funded start-up. Katrina has been told that she creates a good engineering culture in each of these contexts. This talk will be a reflection on how she achieves that.</p>"
