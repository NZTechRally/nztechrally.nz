fullName: Katrina Clokie
jobTitle: CTO
organisation: Fergus
bio: "<p>Katrina moved into engineering leadership from a varied career in individual contributor roles across software development, solution delivery engineering, and testing. She became “famous” in the international testing community as the author of A Practical Guide to Testing in DevOps, an international keynote speaker, a co-founder of the WeTest New Zealand testing community, the founder of Testing Trapeze magazine, and a prolific testing blogger and tweeter back when those platforms were popular.</p>

<p>Over the last five years Katrina has been responsible for leading engineering culture at a variety of NZ organisations. She has worked in a large bank, a high-growth SaaS business, and a Series B funded start-up. Katrina has been told that she creates a good engineering culture in each of these contexts. This talk will be a reflection on how she achieves that.</p>"

{% layoutblock 'talkAbout' %}

<p>
  Many New Zealand organisations base their software engineering aspirations on materials shared by international thought leaders. The practices and advice that come from overseas do not always translate successfully in our teams. 
</p>

<p>
  This keynote is a reflection on the universal foundations of good engineering culture: people, leadership, organisational design, problem scope, technology constraints, and measurement. In each pillar we will explore what is unique to New Zealand and what differentiates good engineering culture for Kiwis.
