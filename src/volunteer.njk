      <p>
        Our mission is to provide inclusive spaces for the NZ software community to connect and grow together.
      </p>
      <p>
        When we said <em>spaces</em>, we’re not just talking about an annual volunteer run event. 
      </p>
      <p>
        We have big dreams beyond the annual flagship NZ Tech Rally conference. We want to run in a sustainable way which includes ongoing community building, paying people for their time, helping people get paid for their content/class/workshops, and etc.
      </p>
      <p>
        But this year, we’re bootstrapping; starting from zero. We will have to rely on different types of volunteers who are interested in our cause until we can get off the ground.

    <div class="card accent-border">
      <p>If those sound cool to you, we feel it’s only right to disclose things that are less-cool. </p>
      <ul>
        <li>You will not get to watch all the talks live or enjoy an event the way paying participants can. But don't worry, our talks are recorded.</li>
        <li>You will have to get up really early on the day of the event, as we need help with setup and pack down.</li>
        <li>When we say time commitment, we really mean it. We’ve estimated that these are the amount of time you need to put in to ensure the event’s success.</li>
