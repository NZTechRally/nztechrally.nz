talkTitle: "Nothing new under the sun; stability through change"
talkExcerpt: "  
<p>Technological change continues at an accelerating pace, driven by innovation in multiple fields. We’re seeing industries, economies, and societies being reshaped; there are both profound opportunities and challenges ahead.</p>

<p>Not everyone is at the cutting edge of innovation, so how do we stay important and useful as we get older? What are some key things that will still matter, and how might we use what we already know to remain relevant?</p>

<p>In this talk, Rachel will explore how psychology, biology, and music offer insights into how we can keep moving forward as leaders and practitioners in the tech world.</p>
