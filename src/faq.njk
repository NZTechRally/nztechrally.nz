        Glad you asked; this has been a large part of our focus.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you’d like to help us make the event more inclusive and welcoming, please send prospective sponsors to our <a href="{{ '/sponsor' | absoluteUrl(site.url) }}">Sponsor’s information page</a>!

        By default, we’re providing these accommodations:
      </p>

      <h4>Physical access</h4>
      <p>
        First, we picked this venue due to its unparalleled access to public transport and reasonable wheelchair access.
      </p>
      <p>
        Though we're closing off downstairs entrance to the room to reduce on-stage disruptions, we will let you in upon request during breaks.
      </p>
      <p>The registration, catering, and other acitivites will be done on the mezzanine on the level above, which is accessible by a nearby elevator or a staircase.
      </p>

      <h4>Live caption</h4>
      <p>
        We've hired professional human captioner to provide live caption for the whole event.
      </p>
      <p>The caption will be visible on screen during talks.</p>

      <h4>Other</h4>
      <p>
        If you require other accommodations, please let us know when you’re purchasing a ticket or email <a href="mailto:registration@nztechrally.nz">registration@nztechrally.nz</a> if you have any questions.

    <div class="section-label accent-border">
      <h3 id="NoOnline" class="section-title">Can I attend the conference online?</h3>
    </div>

    <div class="card accent-border">
      <p>
        No, we do not have the capacity to manage a hybrid experience this year. But we are seriously researching it for our following events.
      </p>
      <p>
        We understand not everyone is comfortable with large crowds or can attend in person. We will work hard to slowly make our events more inclusive as we gain more capacity and experience.
      </p>
      <p>
        Actually, if you have experience hosting a virtual or hybrid event, we’d love to hear from you. Please get in touch by emailing <a href="mailto:volunteer@nztechrally.nz">volunteer@nztechrally.nz</a>.

      <h3 id="recordings" class="section-title">Do you publish talk recordings afterwards?</h3>

    <div class="card accent-border">
      <p>
        Yes, we do!
      </p>
      <p>
        One of our primary purposes is to grow our community. It’s vital that our content is made available to as many people as we can. 
      </p>
      <p>
        We will endeavour to post all of the recordings on our <a rel="external" href="{{ site.youtube }}">Youtube channel</a> for free within a month after the event.
      </p>
      <p>
        And yes, there will be video captions.

    <div class="section-label accent-border">
      <h3 id="recordings" class="section-title">Do have live NZSL interpretation?</h3>
    </div>

    <div class="card accent-border">
      <p>
        Due to availability of NZSL interpreters, in combination with lack of requests from attendees, we will not be providing live NZSL interpretation this year.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, we are still committed to providing accessbile recoding. All videos will be captioned, and we will work with the Deaf community to ensure inclusiveness of the next confernece.
      </p>
      {# <p>
        We’re also excited to work with iSign (Deaf Aotearoa) to book NZSL interpreters for the whole event!
      </p>
      <p>
        They will be positioned on stage with the speakers and filmed in our video recordings.
