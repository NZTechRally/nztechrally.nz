      <p>
        Glad you asked; this has been a large part of our focus.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you’d like to help us make the event more inclusive and welcoming, please send prospective sponsors to our <a href="{{ '/sponsor' | absoluteUrl(site.url) }}">Sponsor’s information page</a>!
      </p>
      <p>
        By default, we’re providing these accommodations:
      </p>

      <h4>Physical access</h4>
      <p>
        First, we picked this venue due to its unparalleled access to public transport and reasonable wheelchair access.
      </p>

      <h4>Live caption</h4>
      <p>
        We've hired professional human captioner to provide live caption for the whole event.
      </p>
      <p>The caption will be visible on screen during talks.</p>

      <h4>Other</h4>
      <p>
        If you require other accommodations, please let us know when you’re purchasing a ticket or email <a href="mailto:registration@nztechrally.nz">registration@nztechrally.nz</a> if you have any questions.

    <div class="section-label accent-border">
      <h3 id="NoOnline" class="section-title">Can I attend the conference online?</h3>
    </div>

    <div class="card accent-border">
      <p>
        No, we do not have the capacity to manage a hybrid experience this year. But we are seriously researching it for our following events.
      </p>
      <p>
        We understand not everyone is comfortable with large crowds or can attend in person. We will work hard to slowly make our events more inclusive as we gain more capacity and experience.
      </p>
      <p>
        Actually, if you have experience hosting a virtual or hybrid event, we’d love to hear from you. Please get in touch by emailing <a href="mailto:volunteer@nztechrally.nz">volunteer@nztechrally.nz</a>.

    <div class="card accent-border">
      <p>
        Yes, we do!
      </p>
      <p>
        One of our primary purposes is to grow our community. It’s vital that our content is made available to as many people as we can. 
      </p>
      <p>
        We will endeavour to post all of the recordings on our <a rel="external" href="{{ site.youtube }}">Youtube channel</a> for free within a month after the event.
      </p>
      <p>
        And yes, there will be video captions.

        Upon request, we will provide you with a black lanyard during registration. This will help our photographer and other attendees identify that you do not wish to be photographed.
      </p>
      <p>
        But we cannot guarantee that we can avoid you completely.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you do find yourself clearly identifiable in a photograph on our website, then don't hesitate to get in touch with us at <a href="mailto:info@nztechrally.nz">info@nztechrally.nz</a>. We will make you unidentifiable, or take the photograph down and delete it from our collection.
