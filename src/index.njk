  <p>
    The theme of this year’s conference is Resilience of people, communities, and organisations in the Aotearoa software industry. 
  </p>
  <p>
    Times have been tough. As an industry, we’ve experienced over-hiring, aggressive growth, burnout, redundancies, reduced budgets, recession, and closures. Many local software organisations have had to adapt to survive. 
  </p>
  <p>
    Attendees will learn from these experiences and get practical advice from other Kiwis who have weathered the storm. Collectively, we need to prepare ourselves for the next cycle of disruption — and there’s no better way than to learn from our neighbours. 
  </p>
  <p>
    Let's rally the NZ software industry together to become more resilient for 2025 and beyond.
  </p>

          Instead of the usual break time which revolves around food, we're switching things up.
        </p>
        <p>
          We're planning a variety of community and career building acitvities during these break-out sessions. Our breaks will revolve around these optional activities.
        </p>
        <p>
          Though we're not taking away food! If you feel like eating, Tākina's in-house catering has surely charged us enough to feed everyone.

          <h3>Break-out discussions with speakers</h3>
          <p>
            We're not doing on-stage Q &amp; A with presenters. 
          </p>
          <p>
            Instead, there will be break-out discussions after each block of speakers. This is where you will have an opportunity to speak directly to our presenters, dive deeper on their topic, and hang out with other attendees who are interested in the same topic. 
          </p>
          <p>
            These break-out discussions are free-form. So you can stay with one presenter, or move between several presenters.
