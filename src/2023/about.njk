        <p>NZ Tech Rally will do this by:</p> 
        <ul>
          <li>Showcasing NZ ingenuity in software</li>
          <li>Providing opportunities to grow our community’s network and impact</li>
          <li>Creating safe, inclusive, accessible and diverse educational content</li>
          <li>Sharing Kiwi adaptation of good software practices and emerging technologies</li>

      </div>

      <div class="card accent-border">
        <p>
          NZ has many events that cater for anyone working in tech, such as Webstock, Tech Week, Code Camp, etc. These events talk about general tech-related topics, ranging from product management to design to code. 
        </p>
        <p>
          NZ also has many events that focus on specific engineering practices or tools: like security, cloud, full-stack, mobile development, JavaScript, robotics, etc.
        </p>
        <p>
          But there isn’t anything that focuses on broad software engineering concerns.
        </p>
        <p> 
          We also noticed that many topics are case studies from overseas and often feature international speakers. 
        </p>
        <p>
          While it is great to look for inspiration outside of the NZ tech bubble, we often forget that there are also great relatable examples in NZ.
        </p>
        <p>
          We want to create a place where all engineering roles like QA, front-end, security, and data can get together and share how they address common software engineering problems in NZ.
        </p>
        <p>
          By learning from each other, we can support, strengthen, uplift, and grow software engineering practices in NZ together; something which can’t be done as effectively in practice-based silos.

          <h3>Community focused</h3>
          <p>We’re here for the NZ software community.</p>
          <p>We believe in Kiwi ingenuity, and how supportive we can be for one another. So we’ll focus on rallying and strength our community to create a vibrant software sector!</p>
        </li>
        <li class="card accent-border">
          <h3>Inclusive</h3>
          <p>
            We want to see more diverse representation of software engineers in New Zealand.
          </p>
          <p>
            We do this through curation of voices from different abilities, career progression, life stages, sexual orientation, and ethnic groups.
          </p>
          <p>
            We long for welcoming and safe spaces for the community to gather, in an accessible and affordable way.

        <li class="card accent-border">
          <h3>Operate with integrity</h3>
          <p>
            We believe in saying what’s on our minds and sticking to our principles while serving our community.
          </p>

        <li class="card accent-border">
          <h3>Pragmatic</h3>
          <p>
            Ideals and theories are great. But it can only be as good the execution.
          </p>
          <p>
            We are all about applicable solutions and relevant content that are well adapted for our NZ software community.
