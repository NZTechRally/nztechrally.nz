bio: "<p>Camy is a Quality Engineering Specialist who has worked across several NZ banks, consultancies and a startup, delivering several projects to market and developing a deep understanding of mobile application development, test automation, release workflows, and powering up several testing guilds and local meetup groups while converting a lot of test sceptics into true believers. She shares her expertise by <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0PWUT4miNI' rel='external'>talking about Quality Engineering</a> at local meetups and conferences.</p>

<p>Camy is highly passionate about building strong engineering practices and a thriving engineering culture. She expresses this passion on her Youtube channel <a href='https://www.youtube.com/@techengineeringlounge7795' rel='external'>Tech Engineering Lounge</a>, where she interviews local engineering experts and tech leaders.</p>

<p>Camy is also a founding member of our testing conference, <a href='https://www.nztestingconf.nz/' rel='external'>NZTestingConf</a>. 

Camy is currently working full-time as a Senior Test Engineer for the Digital Channels domain at the Bank of New Zealand.</p>

<p>When Camy is not at her 9-5 job or busy building NZ Tech Rally, she spends her time in the company of her two Rottweilers, her cat, her family and friends at her Wellington urban homestead, practising the art of homemaking through DIYs, interior design and decoration, cooking and baking, growing seasonal veggies and flowers, building beautiful permaculture landscapes and developing a hilly backyard orchard.</p>"
